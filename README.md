# bingo
A simple bingo game you can play.

## How to run
### To run the bingo game, follow these steps:
1. Put the `project folder` inside `C:\xampp\htdocs` or wherever you have `xampp` installed.
2. Open `xampp`.
3. Start both `Apache` and `MySQL`.
4. On your browser, access http://localhost/bingo/main.php.
5. And you're done! You should be able to access the bingo game on your browser. 
### Alternatively, you can setup the project in whichever way you like. Just make sure to access the main.php file because this will be the landing page of the user.


### You can now access the game on your browser, however we still need to setup the database.
### The database setup assumes that you have the following database details:
- servername : 'localhost'
- username : 'root'
- password : ''
- database : 'bingo'
### To setup the databse simply create a new database named `bingo` then run the `history.sql` file on your database manager.
